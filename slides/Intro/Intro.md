# Proverb

Players in a circle. One player starts with first word of a (non-existing) proverb; circle continues, one word at a time, until the group 'feels' the proverb is done; at that point everybody says 'yes yes yes yes'.
Hint: start with (a) typical proverb word(s), like 'A', 'He who', etc.

# Yes Let's

Excellent warm-up, and great introduction to Accepting .
Pick a group activity, like throwing a party or organizing a picnic. One player starts, saying "Let`s ..." filling in what she wants to do. Then she starts actually doing what she said she wanted to do. A second player jumps in, saying "Let`s ..." do something else, to advance the group activity. Both players say "Yes, let`s do that" and start doing whatever suggested. Third player jumps in, suggests what to do, and again all players loudly agree to do it, and actually do it. Continue till everyone has suggested something.
